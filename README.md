# Chainsaw Wall Mount
Hook-style wall mount for small to medium chainsaws. I'm using it for the Dewalt Flexvolt 16" Cordless Chainsaw

## General Info
Print with a large layer height and relatively dense infill (at least 50%) for strength. Mine is printed in black and yellow, which looks pretty cool but is really just because I ran out of black PETG.

The screw holes are 5mm in diameter to accept either a drywall screw or the slightly larger screw commonly found in self-drilling drywall anchors. Quality drywall anchors will be more than plenty to hold even a very large chainsaw.

## Technologies
- Fusion 360

## Usage
Mount the 3D Printed hook to the wall using either drywall anchors or by attaching directly to a stud. Ensure the chainsaw has clearance to hang and be removed before commiting to a location.
